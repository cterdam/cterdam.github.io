I am involved in AI research and startup projects.

Currently, I am a Research Engineer at [Google
DeepMind](https://deepmind.google).

I graduated from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/)
at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu).

## FAQ

### So what name(s) do you go by?

An unfortunate byproduct of growing up in the globalization era is that
sometimes one ends up with more names than one person really needs. For example,
you might see me associated with any of the following:

- **李良澤**
  - The name in Chinese which I was given shortly after birth.
- **Liangze Li**
  - The official Latin transliteration of my Chinese name using Pinyin.
- **Josh Lee**
  - Back in the day it was still customary for a Chinese kid to get an English
    name, so I arbitrarily picked one for myself just like everyone else. And on
    top of that I also got in the habit of transliterating my family name as Lee
    because it has a less ambiguous pronunciation than Li. Most peers I know
    eventually graduated from their English names once they became adults and
    have just used the Pinyin transliteration of their Chinese names, largely
    because that's what goes on their official documents. When I had the chance,
    I was reluctant to move out of my English name because too many people had
    already known me by it and I also got used to it. Perhaps this has been a
    mistake.
- **Джош Лии**
  - Cyrillic transliteration of "Josh Lee".

### Can you advise our startup?

I'd love to touch base and hear more about your startup.

Alphabet's Conflict of Interest review process is rather strict on formal
advisorships, so I usually cannot promise any long-term outcome until we find
out.

### Can you collaborate with us on a research project?

I am open to hearing about your project and exploring opportunities for
collaboration.

### Can you refer me for a role?

I can refer you if I have a reason to believe you are suitable for the role.
