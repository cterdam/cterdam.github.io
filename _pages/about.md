I am involved in AI research and startup projects.

Currently, I am a Research Engineer at [Google
DeepMind](https://deepmind.google).

I graduated from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/)
at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu).

## FAQ

### So what name(s) do you go by?

An unfortunate byproduct of growing up in the globalization era is that
sometimes one ends up with more names than one person really needs. Here's my
experience:

- **李良澤**
  - The name in Chinese which I was born with.
- **Liangze Li**
  - The official Latin transliteration of my Chinese name using the Pinyin
    system.
- **Josh Lee**
  - Back in the day it was still customary for a Chinese kid to get an English
    name, so I arbitrarily picked one for myself just like everyone else. And on
    top of that I also got in the habit of transliterating my family name as Lee
    because it has a less ambiguous pronunciation than Li. Most of these people
    I know have eventually graduated from their English names once they became
    adults and have just used the Pinyin transliteration of their Chinese names,
    largely because that's what goes on their official documents. When I had the
    chance, I was reluctant to move out of my English name because too many
    people had already known me by this name and I also got used to it. Perhaps
    this has been a mistake.
- **Джош Лии**
  - Cyrillic transliteration of "Josh Lee".

### Can you advise our startup?

I'd love to touch base and hear more about your startup.

Alphabet's Conflict of Interest review process is rather strict on formal
advisorships, so I usually cannot promise any long-term outcome until we find
out.

As of 2025, I am also serving as an advisor in the [Google for
Startups](https://startup.google.com/) program; so we might also find venues to
engage there.

### Can you collaborate with us on a research project?

The field of AI has become much more empirical than it used to be, making it (in
my opinion) easier to get started. I am open to hearing about your project and
exploring opportunities for collaboration. Please share details.

### Can you refer me for a role at $COMPANY?

I can refer you if I have a reason to believe you are suitable for the role.
Please confirm with me and use this [form](https://forms.gle/31WYqGZdKrigTmtt9)
