Writing is an important way to organize one's thoughts. If you can't express
something, you probably haven't thought it through.

I write for two purposes:

- To reflect on what I am reading and learning;
- To make useful information more accessible to people who need it.

My goal in writing is to be as concise as possible. Every unnecessary word is a
burden on the readerâ€™s mind.
