Industry

- [[Blog](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/)] Karpathy’s EOY
  review. Verifiable rewards as a better deal for fixed compute, leading us to
  all sorts of philosophical questions this year.
- [[Company](https://www.mvpstudio.in/)] **MVP Studio**. Builds your MVP for
  you.
- [[微信](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O3X27S_S9fdf8Y76wIdkQA)]
  醫療數據的商業邏輯。

Paper

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21257)] **ReaSeq**. Recommendation systems
  based on in-log IDs have two limitations: (1) the noise and sparsity of
  co-occurrence statistical signals and (2) invisibility of user behavior
  outside of the logs. This work uses a LLM reasoning setup based on logs to
  uncover user demands and product attributes to combat the first limitation,
  and uses a diffusion-based approach to predict invisible user actions to
  compensate for the second.
- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16649)] **JustRL**. Simple, single-stage
  RL training without any so-called fancy tricks. This shown as transferrable
  between models, uses less compute, and matches SOTA on math reasoning tasks.
- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)] **Estimate human body pose from
  Wifi signals.** Relevant [GitHub
  implementation](https://github.com/ruvnet/wifi-densepose/).

Code

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides)] **Banana-slides**. Nano
  Banana for slide deck generation.
- [[GitHub](https://github.com/11cafe/jaaz)] **Jaaz**. Prompt enhancement or
  multimodal generation workflows.
- [[GitHub](https://github.com/archistico/ShadeOfColor2)] **ShadeOfColor2**.
  Encode any file as an image.

Have a great week!
