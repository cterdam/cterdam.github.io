- [[Blog](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/)]
  First glimpse into the work of Thinking Machines Lab. Inference systems can be
  made deterministic by using “batch-invariant” GPU kernels
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/batch_invariant_ops)
  implementation).

- [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.799/)] Alternative
  sampling strategies are shown to be conceptually a better fit if using a text
  space LM on numerical regression tasks.

- [[Blog](https://tokens-for-thoughts.notion.site/post-training-101)]
  Post-training primer.

- [[Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents)]
  Anthropic’s new blog shows substantial gains from simply using Claude to
  optimize MCP servers.

- [[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/driaforall/mem-agent)] 4B model trained
  on Obsidian-style markdown operations pairs performance with much larger
  models on memory tasks - and can be used as an MCP server to a bigger model.

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples)]
  Crew AI - YAAF (Yet Another Agent Framework)

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/sentient-agi/ROMA)] ROMA - YAAF (Yet Another
  Agent Framework)

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/mmulet/term.everything)] term.everything - Run
  GUI apps in terminal.

Have a great week!
