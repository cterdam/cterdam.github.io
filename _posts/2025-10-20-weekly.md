- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08338)] Synthetic customers for purchase
  intent prediction. Rather than generating a Likert score for intent (and there
  would be many relevant techniques there, such as [sampling
  methods](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.799/)), generate a
  freeform text response and match it with reference responses by emb sim to
  produce Likert scores. The result is "high human test–retest reliability while
  maintaining realistic response distributions", with interpretability
  advantages.

- [[Paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.13935)] Think RAG but instead of
  retrieving context, retrieve reasoning instructions.

- [[Leaderboard](https://nof1.ai/)] Alpha Arena - Trading as a benchmark.

  Ion Stoica’s story.

  trick to get more diversity from aligned LLMs.

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21476)] Humor understanding abilities seem
  to be strongly related to STEM training & reasoning.

- [[Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/not-another-workflow-builder/)] Harrison
  Chase’s view on the paradox of graphical workflow builders. Simpler workflows
  are easier to build with just no-code agents. More complicated workflows seem
  to necessitate code.

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06813)] There is still hope for
  under-represented programming languages.

- [[Tweet](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1979217645854511402)] Constant mismatch

Have a great week!
