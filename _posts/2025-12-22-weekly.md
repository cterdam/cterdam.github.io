  **Monitorability**. A tradeoff exists between model size and monitorability,
  defined as an external monitor’s ability to predict certain aspects of a
  model’s inference. CoT length is positively related to monitorability; A
  smaller model with higher inference compute is found to have better
  monitorability than a larger model with less inference compute, with only a
  small capability hit.

  When modeling a user group with LLMs, current approaches oversimplify by
  directly extrapolating surface behavior from demographics, skipping
  intermediate psychological processes, thus causing inconsistencies & lack of
  diversity. Belief-based modeling as an alternative to behavior-based modeling
  of user groups.
