- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13292)] Embedding initialization shown to
  be related to Grokking (delayed generalization). On the XOR task, embeddings
  trained on a small model is shown to accelerate generalization (accelerate
  grokking) when used as initialization for a larger model. Relevant [prior
  work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02541).

  that matter for GDP.
