- [[Blog](https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/)]
  HOPE. A model as a set of nested sub-optimizers, each with its own context
  flow and hyperparams. Relevant
  [paper](https://abehrouz.github.io/files/NL.pdf).

- [[Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison)] Putting up
  only 250 posts online is what it takes to poison an LLM of arbitrary size.
  Relevant [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192).

- [[Blog](https://pub.sakana.ai/ctm/)] Biologically motivated attempt to bring
  explicit recurrence back to the architecture.

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/agentmark-ai/agentmark)] AgentMark - An
  abstraction of prompt templates and API calling.

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02825)] ABC (Agentic Benchmark Checklist)
  - Benchmark for benchmarks. Outcome validity and task validity.

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16842)] Anomaly detection for LLM
  benchmarks. ~5% of questions in GSM8K are invalid, if we make the assumption
  that all questions in a benchmark need to test the same ability.

- [[GitHub](https://github.com/google/adk-python)] Google ADK - Yet another
  agent framework.

- [[Hackathon](https://ai-gateway-game-hackathon.vercel.app/)] AI Gateway
  hackathon. Game as eval.

- [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20836)] The choice of using model-specific
  optimized prompts or using a universal fixed prompt has a non-negligible
  impact on LLM ranking results.

Have a great week!
